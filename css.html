            <h3 style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">What is CSS</h3>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML<BR> dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media
        <BR><BR> <h3  style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"> Brief History of CSS</h3><br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;CSS was created HÃ¥kon Wium Lie to allow web designers to change the layout, colors, and fonts of their websites. Originally, websites were meant to be used by researchers only, so the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; decoration did not matter. However, when websites became widespread, the need to make them look nice grew.
   <br><br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;1994- HÃ¥kon Wium Lie proposed the idea of CSS.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
   1996- The first version of CSS was invented.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
   1998- CSS 2 was released and work on CSS 3 began. CSS 3 was very different from the other versions, fot instead of being a single monolithic specification, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;it was published as a set of separate documents known as modules. Each module dealt with a relatively small subset of the overall specification, and either added new features or refined and extended existing features. All additions and enhancements to the specification were written in order to be backward-compatible with older versions of CSS.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
   2011- CSS 2.1 was released, which fixed the errors found in CSS 2
