        <h3 style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">What is HTML</h3>
<br>
HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.<BR>

Hyper Text: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.<BR>

Markup language: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.<BR>

Web Page: A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.<BR><BR>
  
   <h3  style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"> Brief History of HTML</h3><br><br>
    In the late 1980's , a physicist, Tim Berners-Lee who was a contractor at CERN, proposed a system for CERN researchers. In 1989, he wrote a memo proposing an internet based hypertext system.<br>
    
    Tim Berners-Lee is known as the father of HTML. The first available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags" proposed by Tim in late 1991. The latest version of HTML is HTML5, which we will learn later in this tutorial.<br><br>
    <H3 style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"> Features of HTML</H3> 
1) It is a very easy and simple language. It can be easily understood and modified.<br>

2) It is very easy to make an effective presentation with HTML because it has a lot of formatting tags.<br>

3) It is a markup language, so it provides a flexible way to design web pages along with the text.<br>

4) It facilitates programmers to add a link on the web pages (by html anchor tag), so it enhances the interest of browsing of the user.<br>

5) It is platform-independent because it can be displayed on any platform like Windows, Linux, and Macintosh, etc.<br>

6) It facilitates the programmer to add Graphics, Videos, and Sound to the web pages which makes it more attractive and interactive.<br>

7) HTML is a case-insensitive language, which means we can use tags either in lower-case or upper-case.<br><br>

    <h3 style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Building blocks of HTML</h3><br><br>
    An HTML document consist of its basic building blocks which are:<br>
    
    <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"> TAG: </span>An HTML tag surrounds the content and apply meaning to it. It is written between < and > brackets.<br>
    <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"> Attribute: </span>An attribute in HTML provides extra information about the element, and it is applied within the start tag. An HTML attribute contains two fields: name & value<BR>
       <BR> <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"> Elements:</span> An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML file. In an HTML file, everything written within tags are termed as HTML elements.

            <a href="runhtml.html" class="btn" style="float: right;">Run HTML Code</a><br>
    HTML Formatting is a process of formatting text for better look and feel. HTML provides us ability to format text without using CSS. There are many formatting tags in HTML. These tags are used to make text bold, italicized, or underlined. There are almost 14 options available that how text appears in HTML and XHTML.

<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">HTML HEADING</span><BR><BR>
    <a href="runhtml.html" class="btn" style="float: right;">Run HTML Code</a><br>
There are six different HTML headings which are defined with the h1 to h6 tags, from highest level h1 (main heading) to the least level h6 (least important heading).<br>

    h1 is the largest heading tag and h6 is the smallest one. So h1 is used for most important heading and h6 is used for least important.<br>
    <br><span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">HTML Paragraph</span><br>
    HTML paragraph or HTML p tag is used to define a paragraph in a webpage. Let's take a simple example to see how it work. It is a notable point that a browser itself add an empty line before and after a paragraph. An HTML p tag indicates starting of new paragraph<br>
